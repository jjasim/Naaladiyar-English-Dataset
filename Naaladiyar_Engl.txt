Who today dine luxuriously tomorrow beg$Those who ate erewhile, course after course, food of six flavours, supplied by their$complaisant spouse, now roam as paupers and beg a mess of pottage here and$there; if so, let wealth be$counted as a thing of nought!
Wealth abides not, share it and enjoy$When you own ample wealth acquired by blameless means, with many sharing eat$the grain that steers have trodden out! In centre poised prosperity stands with no$man, but revolves like the waggon's wheel.
Mighty warriors fall.$Those who rode resplendent forth on the neck of an elephant, beneath the state$umbrella's shade, as the leaders of the host, when 'other deeds' destroy, shall change$and fall, while foes lead away their wives as captives.
Do your duty, knowing the instability of all things.Time flies! Death comes!$The things of which you said, ‘they stand, they stand,' stand not; mark this, and$perform what befits, yea! what befits, with all your power! Your days are gone, are$gone! and death close pressing on is come, is come!
Give before death comes.$When you have gained and hold in hand any single thing, retain it not with the$thought, ‘This will serve some other day!’ Those who have given betimes shall$escape the desert road along which death, an unyielding foe, drags his captives away.
Death inevitable. Hoard not!$Man's days pass not their assigned bound. None here on earth have ever escaped$death's power, made off and got free.$O hoarder of ample wealth, dispense it!$On the morn the funeral drum will sound. 
Death inevitable.$Death every day takes that fount of light the sun as a measure, metes out your days,$and so devours.Do deeds of virtue full of kindly grace. Though all are born, none are$exempt from death.
The wealth of the foolish like the lightning's flash.$The ample wealth of men of mean understanding, who say, ' We're rich,' yet ponder$not their path and end, appears, and perishes, and leaves no trace; like the flash,$when the black thunder-cloud by night opens its mouth. 
The miser loses all.$He eats not, sheds no light of splendour around, performs no deeds that merit lofty$praise, soothes no sorrow that choice friends feel, spends nought, but hoards his$wealth in vain : “Aha! he's lost it all,' shall men pronounce.
The miser like the honey-bee.$Those who stint in clothes and food, and mortify their bodies, yet do not deeds of$deathless virtue, and bestow nothing, hoarding shall suffer loss:— Lord of the cloudcapped hills !--this the hoarding honey-bee attests. 
Age will come. Be wise early$"Grey eld will come,’—the wise remembering this renounce the world even in tender$age; but they who joy in youth, unstable, never free from fault, shall erewhile painfully$rise up leaning on a staff. 
All is vanity.$Served are the ties of friendship; minished are the pleasant ones; love's bonds are$loosened too; then look within and say, what profit is there in this joyous life of thine ?$The cry comes up as from a sinking ship! 
Men are loath to give up bodily pleasures.$Speech falters, they lean on a staff, and walk tottering, their teeth fall out; yet, till the$vessel (the body) is scorned by all, they linger in the house, still indulging fond$desires; to these no way of safety opens out. 
The cherished wife of your youth.$To men that cherish weak desire for her that's doomed to droop and fail, supporting$her palsied limbs with a staff, and then to fall and pass away, what anguish comes,$when she grasps in her hands the staff her mother held!
Endless series of successive generations.$My mother bore me, left me here, and went to seek her mother,$who herself went in search of her mother; and thus in ceaseless round goes on the mother-quest.$Such is the grace this world affords!
The lamb before the sacrificer.$The lamb in the ruddy slaughter-house will crop the fragrant shoots that dangle from$the garland in the slayer's hand; such transient gladness of the thoughtless, youthful$hour is never found amid the wise
Fruit only ripens to fall. Youth leads to decay.$The sweet fruit from every tree that bears in the dewy grove must fall to earth.$Thus youth decays. Desire not her whose eyes gleam bright as darts. Full soon she too will$walk bent down, with a staff to aid her dim sight. 
Constant anxieties about health.$’How old are you ?' 'How last your teeth ?' and, ‘Do you eat two courses yet?' men$ask with kindly courtesy. By such close questions urged, the wise will learn to judge$the body as a thing of nought.
Against Procrastination.$Say not, 'in after time we'll learn virtue, we're young;' but while wealth is yours$conceal it not; do virtuous deeds. When evil tempests rage, not the ripe fruit alone,$but the unripe fruit's fair promise also falls.
The infant slain by death.$Relentless death is roaming round, and eyes his man! 'Tis true. Take up your wallet,$scape betimes. He bears away the new-born babe, while the mother sorely laments.$It is good to bear in mind his guile. 
Mighty kings die.$Even kings that rode on elephants beneath the state umbrella's shade, like the moon$appearing over some bill, have had their names proclaimed on earth as dead ;— not$any in this world have escaped.
Time is fleeting,—use it$As the measure of your days the shining orb each day unfailing rises; so before your$joyous days have passed away, perform ye 'fitting deeds of grace';$for none abide on earth.
Mutability of earthly joys.$The marriage drums that sounded out in the festive hall, there and that very day have$served for him as funeral drums! Men of lofty minds will note that thus it haps, and$will strive to gain the way to escape.
The funeral.$They march and then strike once! A little while they wait, then strike the drum a$second time. Behold, how fine! The third stroke sounds. They veil it, take the fire, and$go forth :—the dying bear the deed!
Death pours contempt on human joys.$To him, who, although he sees them bear the corpse to the burning ground, while$friends in troops loudly lament, boldly asserts that wedded life is bliss on earth, the$funeral drum speaks out, and mocks his vain utterance. 
The dead body$When the 'soul', that, taking its stand in this skin clad frame, has fully wrought its$works, and partaken of life's experiences, has gone forth, what matters it whether you$attach ropes to the body and drag it away, or carefully bury it, or throw it aside in any$place you light upon, or if many revile the departed ? 
The body a bubble$'Like a bubble, that in pelting rain appears full oft, and disappears, is this our frame.'$So sages have judged, steadfast in wisdom, and have decided to end this dubious$strife. On this wide earth who equal these?
The body like a cloud on the hillside.$Those who've gained and held fast by this well-knit frame (a human body) should$take the gain the body they have gained is intended to yield. Like a cloud that$wanders over the hills, the body here appears,$and abiding not, departs leaving no trace behind.
The body like dew on the tip of a blade of grass.$Considering that all things are transient as the dew-drop on the tip of a blade of$grass, now, now at once, do virtuous deeds! "Even now he stood, he sat, he fell—$while his kindred cried aloud he died :' such is man's history!
All human relationships merely temporary.$Unasked men come, appear in the home as kinsmen, and then silently go. As the$bird silently deserts the tree where its nest yet remains, and goes far off,$so these leave but their body to their friends.
The door closed. Too late.$‘Yet those within are blest,' so saying, they look up, but obtain no entrance: their$place is at the outer gate. There will they suffer much, who thro' lack of former$penitence do no penance now.$[In a former state penance won for them a human$shape. As men they have now failed.] 
What wilt thou do in the end thereof?$Say not, O silly soul, we will live desiring wealth and die forgetting virtue! We'll say$that ceaselessly toiling thou shalt live long; but tell me, what wilt thou do when all thy$happy days are over? 
The wise accept the sorrows of life as retributive.$When the ‘fruit of deeds' is come, the fool sighs heavily, and all his soul dies out; but$those who reflect and say, ,'Tis old desert,' will pass beyond the bound of life's$perplexity, and escape (by devoting themselves to virtue).
Virtue is the gain. The body mere refuse.$As the gain from the mortal frame now reached —and which is so hard to reach —$with all thy might lay hold of virtue's lasting good.$As the juice expressed from the sugar-cane 'twill afterwards be thine aid, when the body goes like refuse flung away. 
The same. The body only sapless stalks.$Those who have pressed the sugar-cane, and early taken the juice, when the refuse$heaped up burns, will suffer no grief: those who have toiled and gained the fruit won$from embodied existence will feel no pangs when death shall come. 
Death stands waiting behind you. Delay not!$‘This day ?’ That day? What day? O question not the time! Bethink you death stands$behind you ever waiting! Put from you every evil thing; and with all your powers$embrace the virtue which sages teach.
Use the body to gain the world to come.$When you examine closely the mighty gains to be acquired by birth in a human$shape, if they seem manifold, perform not deeds which suit the body's frame alone,$but deeds whose fruit is joy in the world to come!
A benefit conferred by the worthy on the worthy.$The banyan seed, though it be minute as one might see in dreams, grows to a mighty$tree of amplest shade; so gifts from a virtuous hand, received by a worthy hand,$though small, will hide the diminish'd heavens. 
Days pass.$Daily they see the passing day added to the sum of the days gone by, as a day that$is spent from out the store of their days, yet daily, as they see day dawn, they say$joyously, 'This day will abide with us till the close of day?’
Why should man maintain the perishable body by dishonourable begging?$Parting with honour's jewel I might still consent to live a suppliant's life of shame, if$when maintained by such disgrace, this body could abide in strength and last for$length of days.
Any slight wound may fester, and reduce the fairest form to a loathsome state.$‘O gentle maiden, fair and good !' These paragons that thus rave, know they not 'the$heavenly home invisible?’ Let a bit of skin be broken slight as an insect's wing, and$you need the stick that drives a way the crows !
The body's beauty only skin - deep.$If the body which, with a covering of skin above, possesses many apertures, owes its$beauty only to that outward cloak that veils the false (the inner foulness), then is it$fitting to say no word of lustful desire which hides the false from itself by the covering$veil, but to regard that body as an undeveloped embryo.
Outward adornment is not inward purification.$Will impurity ever cease from the worthless body which the great have abandoned,$knowing it to be reeking with odours from processes connected with nutrition, though$aromatics be chewed, the head covered with garlands, and the body adornedwith$false splendour?
Female eyes shall not bewilder me !$Shall I abandon (my ascetic purpose) because blind, low men worry me, saying (that$woman's eye is like) the water-lily in the clear stream, or the warring carp, or a$javelin? I will pursue my virtuous way as having seen (that) the eye's real nature (is),$like (that of) the palm-tree fruit (which is) scooped out, after the water has been$drained off!
The beauty of women's teeth shall not bewilder me.$Though worthless men untaught should fret my soul and rave of teeth like jasmine$buds and pearls, shall I forego my fixed resolve, who have seen in the burning$ground those bones—the fallen teeth —strewn round for all to see ?
'This vile body.'$(The body) is entrails, and marrow, and blood, and bone, and connecting tendons,$and skin, and here and there flesh interposed, and fat. In the midst of these, what$sort of a being is she who wears the fresh garlands?
The body is disgusting.$The fool will address the earthen pot (the body), from which defilement oozes, which$from nine disgusting outlets scatters pollution, and in which slimy liquids move to and$fro—and say, 'O thou of the rounded arms,' ‘O thou with armlets decked, ‘—because$it is made bright to his eyes by a covering of black skin.
The body a prey to decay.$They know not what the body is; with sandal paste and flowers they make it fine.$Have they not seen, I pray, the vultures and their mates in flocks with busy beaks$devour the body foul when the chariot-axle is snapt?
The eyeless skulls teach.$The skulls of the dead, at the sight of which the gazer fears, with deep cavernous$eyes appear, and grinning say to those who still survive, 'Guard well! In virtue's path$stand fast. This is the body's grace and worth.
The sight of the skulls cures pride.$The skulls of the dead, grinning so as to excite disgust, cure the vain lovers of life of$their folly. Those who are cured of this folly, seeing (the skulls in the burning ground),$say “such is this body,' and so value themselves as nothing.
Penitence puts sin to flight.$As when a lamp enters darkness dies, so sin stands not before man's penitence. As,$when in a lamp the oil wastes, darkness rushes in, so evil takes its stand where$deeds of virtue cease. 
Put away useless studies.$The chief of men reflect on change, disease, old age, and death, and do their needful$work. Those who raving teach the endless round of sevenfold science (numerology), and the lore of stars (astrology), are maddest of the foolish throng. 
Renunciation at once.$The chief of men in quite thought discern how house, and youth, and beauty's grace,$and high estate, and wealth, and strength, all pass away; and thus, to save$themselves, prolonging not the time, renounce all these.
Pleasure and pain.$Though wretched men suffer afflictions many a day, yet one day's delight they$eagerly desire. The men of calm and full wisdom, in pleasure's core see pain, and$quit the pleasant household paths
Unreflecting soul, why not seek the way of peace?$In vain is my youth spent. Even now disease and old age will come. O soul ! be bold;$wrangle no more with me, but rise! Wilt thou not go where both thou$and I may gain virtue's path? 
Marriage to be dreaded.$Though your wife possess no excellence and bear no child, it is hard to get rid of the$marriage bond. For this cause since he who weds puts sorrow on, in olden days the$learned made marriage a synonym of dread.
Patience and perseverance.$When troubles arise, hard to resist, to cause them to break the vows which their lofty$spirits have pledged, the men of power set griefs aside and firmly fix their souls in$right. These are the blessed, guarding decorum's rule. 
Forbearance and pity for evil-doers.$To bear with those that speak contemptuous words; yea, more, to say, 'Ah, will these$sink in the other world to hell, the place of fire, as fruit of their contemptuous words;'$and to grieve, is duty of the perfect man.
Repression of sensuous emotions.$He who undisturbed, in the ordered way of right, has power to guard and guide the$desires and lusts that find entrance by the five sense-gates, called 'body, mouth, eye,$nose, and ear' - unfailing shall gain 'release.' 
The bitter pleasures of life.$Though wretched men behold afflictions urge and press, renunciation is not in their$thoughts; delight they eagerly desire.$The great in every joy behold its pain, and seek it not.
Disregard of the esteem or disesteem of men.$Who pass esteeming us, let them pass on! And those who contemn and trample on$us as they pass, let them too pass on! If even a fly (especially unclean) should climb,$trampling on their head, it is well that the wise who know its worth,$should feel no wrath.
Resolute men bear meekly the evils of life.$Although disgraces throng thickly, and may not be repulsed, will those whose minds$are set upon finishing the work begun, renounce sweet life's unfailing worth in their$impatience, whenever they see (evils)? 
Rashness in speech hurts one's self.$If a man open his mouth and speak unguarded words, his words will ceaselessly$burn his soul. The wise who ceaselessly hear, and ponder well and calmly, even in$their wrath, will never give utterance to words of fire.
The good man's meekness. The low man's ungoverned fury.$When men who are beneath them confront them, and speak unseemly words, the$excellent wax not hot with anger. The base man will brood over it, chafe and rave for$all the town to hear, and leap, and dash his head against a post.
Self-restraint in youth, gifts from the poor, and forbearance in the mighty are excellent.$The young man's self-restraint is self-restraint. The gift of him who owns no stores of$wealth is gift indeed. When wan has means and might to punish every fault, if he$forbear, call him the patient man.
Noble instinct restrains.$As stones the base shower down their bitter words;$the noble bear, in sight of all, and$let them pass, by sense of noble worth constrained; $like serpent's crest at once by touch of sacred ash subdued. 
Return not evil for evil.$When men stand forth as our enemies, and would begin the conflict, to decline the$strife is not, in the language of the wise, lack of power. Even when men have$confronted and done us intolerable evils, it is good not to do them evil in return.
The wrath of the base never expends itself. That of the good of itself dies out. Long$time though base men's wrath run on, it spreads abroad, and knows no time when$heat is spent; as the heat of water, when boiled at cooking time, itself grow's cool, the$ire of perfect men of worth abates.
It is not the way of the noble to do evil to those who injure them.$Though men think not of good received, and do much ill to men of family whose fame$has touched the sky, these still do good; nor are they wont provoked by faults, to$render evil to the thankless ones.
Return not railing for railing.$Though a dog, in range, should lay hold of them, there are none in the world who, in$return, would lay hold of it with their mouth; and thus, when low men speak, not what$is fitting, but low words, will high-minded men,$in reply, utter such words with their mouth.
Don't argue with the foolish.$Lord of the pleasant land, where down the cool mountains the streams fall as$garlands!— With a fool hold no converse. If you speak with him, in replying he will$pervert your words. To slip away from him as best you can is well.
Insults from inferiors.$When persons not our equals say unfitting things, to bear and to be still is worthy$conduct. The world girt by foaming waters regards not a contrary course as praiseworthy, but as discreditable. 
Harsh words of those who love are better than complaisant words of foes.$Lord of the swelling sea's cool shore, where bright insects hum around every$flower!—Are severe words from loving lips harder to bear, if men can only rightly$estimate their result, than pleasant words that strangers courteously speak?
The thoroughly disciplined and contented man is happy.$Those who know what should be known and rule themselves thereby; who fear what$should be feared ; who use all their faculties to bless the world; and whose nature$rejoices in all good gained: are for ever free from woes.
If a friend act doubtfully, forgive or quietly withdraw.$When two with strict accord unite in friendship's bond, if one betray the other's$confidence by unkind act, this latter should endure as best he may. And if he can't$endure, he should not divulge it, but withdraw himself.
If a friend do evil to you, think it good, refrain from anger and blame yourself;$but never forsake him.$Lord of the woodlands! Separation is hard even to beasts; therefore if friends do$things that are unpleasant, think them pleasant. bid yourself cease (from wrath), and$blame yourself alone; but forsake not those that have been joined to you in the$intimacy of friendship.
Forbearance cements friendship.$Is not the reason why the close friendship of the great is sought, that they will bear$even with faults hard to endure? Lord of the good land of high mountains, with$resounding waterfalls! — to good people are intimate friends rare?
Bear want$Though sore wasted with hunger, let not men tell out their destitution to ungracious$churls. Those indeed who lack resolution to deny themselves may tell their wants to$those who are able and willing to save them from destitution.
Forsake pleasure that brings disgrace. To avoid guilt is the chief matter.$Although shameful things may present themselves. as things that yield pleasure, flee$from that pleasure's side! Though thou couldst see pleasures that cease not soon, —$Lord of the land of fountains high! — the guiltless way is best.
Never desire evil, nor eat with improper persons, nor lie.$Though ruin seize you plan not ruin to the just! Though body's flesh should waste, eat$not from hands unfit! Though the whole earth o'er-arched by heaven accrue as gain,$never speak word with falsehood mixed!
Against adultery.$The fear it brings is great; its pleasure is brief; each day if it is divulged death$threatens by the king's decree; and ever it is a deed that tends to the pains of hell;$O shamefast men, desire not your neighbour's wife.
The sinner forfeits much, and incurs much.$Virtue, praise, friendship, greatness, all these four draw not anigh the men who covet$their neighbour's wife. Hatred, disgrace and guilt, with fear, these four possessions$abide with men who covet their neighbour's wife.
Fear on every side.$In entering in there's fear; in home returning fear; during enjoyment is fear; in$guarding the secret is fear; it evermore brings fear: why shuns he not with dread the$entrance of neighbour's house?
The way of transgressors is hard.$If any one see, disgrace lights on the house; if any hand should seize, leg's maimed;$in the doing of the shameful deed is dread; it yields as fruit vast hell's affliction :$tell me, O profligate, what measure of delight is thine?
Punishment of ravishers.$Those who, in a former state, without any regard to right, becoming associates of the$mean, enjoyed the embraces of beautiful women, and by violence approached their$neighbour's wife, in this state will become eunuchs, and dancing shall earn their bread.
Why should a man who has his own wife look at his neighbour's?$While his loving wife dwells in his home, the tender one whom he espoused, —$seeking (out an auspicious) day, and sounding the drum, for many folks to know,—$and 'whom he guards as his own, what means a man's glance at another's wife?
Pleasure dearly purchased.$The enjoyment of the man of unstable heart, who under the influence of infatuation$approaches his neighbour's wife and sets his affections upon her, while neighbours$spread abroad his guilt, and kinsmen dread and mourn, is like (that of the person$who takes pleasure in) licking a serpent's head.
The passions of virtuous men are under control.$The disease of lust in men mighty (in wisdom) gains not ascendancy, is not revealed,$does not remain fixed on many objects.$O! it is a cruel conflict; but fearing to incur shame in the midst of their foes, they say$nothing about it, and it is extinguished within them.
Lust the most deadly enemy.$Arrow and fire and sun with glistening rays may rage and burn; but these burn the$outer man alone. Lust rages and distracts and burns the mind, and is more to be$feared than they.
Fire and lust.$From the ruddy fire that fiercely rises in the village you may scape by bathing in$water. — Although you bathe in water, lust will burn; and though you climb the hill$and hide you there, still lust will burn!
Unchilled by adversity the good do good : heaven's gate is open to them.$Even in their adverse hour, up to the measure of their means, as in the prosperous$times, with large rejoicing heart to give is their nature still. To such good men$heaven's gate is never closed.
Death, old age, disease stand round. Give!$Before (you) are death's day and age detestable ; behind is disease that humbles$pride. Discursive thoughts indulge not. Cling not to earth. Eat, sharing food; hide not$your powers while wealth is in your hand.
It is useless saving: fate gives and takes away.$Though dread of want they do not relieve the woes of men who as suppliants draw$near! Yet although men enjoy and give, wealth grows in growing time: cling to it, and$yet it flies when former deeds that brought wealth have lost their power.
Give according to your power.$Daily having given somewhat, though but the fraction of a grain of rice, according to$your ability, eat ye (your own food).$Those who gave not in that world, men say on this earth girt by deep waters are$those on whose hearth nothing is cooked
Do charity for the sake of this world and the future ; and beg not.$Regarding the other world and this world, give to any suppliant, in fitting way,$according to your ability. And if on account of poverty giving is not possible, yet$refraining from begging is twice as meritorious as giving.
The fertile and sterile palms.$Those who live desired of many are as a fertile palm entered in the altar's enclosure$in midmost of the town. Those who, even when their house grows great, give not$before they eat, are like the sterile palm in the burning ground.
In troublous time charity must not be omitted.$Even when the rain rains not in due season, if all the world should fail in virtuous$actions that ought to be done, —Lord of the warring sea's cool shore, where acrid$fume of fish in Punnai's perfume dies! - how scapes the world?
Give to him who cannot recompense thee.$Denying to no out-stretched hand, to give to needy men as he hath power, is duty of$a man.—Lord of the swelling sea's cool shore !—A gift to those that can return the$gift is usury!
Give though you have but little. The beggar's dish is filled in time.$Say not ‘ 'tis passing little,' nor ‘ ' tis nought I give;' on all confer thy boon of virtuous$charity, Like the dish the mendicant presents from door to door, by frequent doles$'twill be filled full.
The fame of charitable deeds.$The sound of beaten drum a katham off they'll hear; the thunder's voice through a$whole yojanai will reach men's ears; the three successive worlds will hear the word$that says, ‘Men excellent their gifts have given.'
Deeds come home to the doer.$Although you send forth the tender calf amid many cows, it has unerring skill to seek$out its own mother. Deeds of old days have even so the power to search him out to$whom their fruit pertains.
A merely animal life.$Beauty and youth, and glittering wealth and reverence abide not in one stay. To him$who, though he sees this, does no single virtuous act in this one stage of being, life's$joy stands with the body and falls with it. 
Wishes are inoperative.$Who would not see Prosperity? All seek her gifts; but as men's ways are, so each$man's enjoyments are meted out. Who made the Vilam's apple round? Or who gave$its dusky hue to the Kalam fruit?
What must be, must be.$Not even saints can drive away predestined ills; and all the fated gain must needs$accrue. In time of drought who can bestow the rain ? Or who can check its rich$abundance when it falls?
Vicissitudes of life are fate.$Those who lose like stately palms, when their greatness is gone, become small asthe$millet seed, hiding their glory within, —and so they pass their days. This is the fruit of$deeds of former days: when you think of it, what other cause can there be? 
Why ignorant men live, while the wise die.$Those that know the fruit of varied and profound learning die off, while the unlearned$joyously live on. Would you know the cause ? — The unlearned posses within no$'sap of sapience'; — so death deems then refuse stalks, and takes them not! 
Why some beg from door to door.$Lord of the sea's cool shore, where amid the wave swans sport, tearing to shreds the$Adambu flowers! When those whose hearts are sore with urgent need standbegging,$and wander through the long street, in sight of all, this is the fruit of former deeds. 
Why even wise men sin.$They are not ignorant; but, though what man should know they know, yet they do$deeds that bring guilt to their souls. — Lord of the wide sea's pleasant shore, where$breezes breathe the lily's fragrance round ! — This comes from former deeds. 
Desires are unavailing.$On the earth begirt by gathering waters no men desire in anywise evil things, but$choice fruit of good things. Yet whether they desire, or abhor, it is hard to shun the$touch of what fate assigns.
Fate is unalterable. Why grieve?$The early fates diminish not, nor do they increase, they come not in order$changed help in troublous times is none; what haps will happen, there and then; and$so, when all things fail, why grieve?
Broken promises.$O maid with many armlets graced! To answer 'no' disgraces no man, when the boon$asked exceeds his means. It is the world's course. But to delay and cheat the soul$faint with desire is a sin like his who 'slays' a benefit conferred. 
Natures change not.$Men of worth, and men unworthy too, retain their natures ever unchanged. Whoever$they be that eat it, sugar can never grow bitter; and margosa is bitter even when$eaten by gods. 
Friends in adverse and prosperous time.$When a man moves prosperonsly on, devoted kinsfolk are countless as shining stars$that move in the upper heaven. But when grievous affliction haps,—Lord of the$dripping hills! —few claim close alliance with him.
Wealth the essential things. Virtue, wealth, and pleasure.$Of the three things that endure upon this faultless earth, he who gains the midmost$gains the two extremes also. He who gains not the midmost gains the cruel smart$that the turtle feels when put into the pot to boil.
The words of the rich and of the poor.$A young heifer fetches a good price when it is the calf of a good cow; so the words of$rich men though unlearned, pass current. Poor men's words, like the plough when$moisture is scanty, merely graze the surface and are of no avail.
Wisdom cannot benefit the undisciplined.$O wide-eyed one! though you cook the wild gourd pouring in salt, ghee, milk, curds,$and spices, it never loses its bitterness. So those who never discipline themselves,$though they may learn extensive works of true wisdom, never become disciplined.
Scorn the scorners.$When men scorn you, before their faces scorn them too ! what has a man to do with$them? — Lord of shore where beauteous Punnai-flowers perfume the glades that$surround the swelling tide, — what fated comes to all! 
Cows of many colours, milk always white. Virtue one-many sects.$Though cows in form are diverse, the milk they yield is not diverse. The way of virtue,$like that milk, is one in nature, though the schools that teach it here are like those$cows, of many forms.
Four questions. The common lot.$Look well! of whom hath not the world found word to say ? And who have not by$prudence prospered in life's way? Ah! who in life's mid course no bitter grief have$known ? Ah! who to end of life have kept their wealth their own?
Nothing accompanies in death but deeds.$Save a man's deed: nought goes with him, search where you will. The body which$men cherish so, and adorn, is itself profitless indeed when death shall seize and$hurry off with it.
Men lead lives of self-indulgence.$The burning ground is filled with the corpses of men that will not give themselves up$to a self renouncing life, but oscillate amid sorrows; and the maws of perverted$foolish men are a mere burning-ground for beasts and birds. 
Penalty for imprisoning birds.$Their legs in iron bound, as slaves to alien lords they will till the black and barren soil,$who snared and kept in cages partridges and quails, that dwell in wilds where beetles$hum amid the flowers. 
The penalty incurred by crab-eaters.$Like fire their palms shall glow, their fingers rotaway, who loved in other times on$crabs to feed, and broke their joints, what time the guilt of ‘olden deeds' comes home,$and leprosy's fierce pangs assail.
Bad companions.$Even things (soft and soothing) like ghee, when joined with the fierce heat of fire, will$blaze and burn, and cause bitter anguish : so even upright men are perverted and$give themselves up to deeds of utter evil, when they attach themselves to those$whose deeds are evil. 
Friendships with great and mean.$Great men's intimate regard will daily grow in order due like the crescent moon. Mean$men's alliance like the full moon that rides the sky daily by degrees dwindles away of itself. 
Disappointment and danger from foolish attachments.$Thou didst attach thyself (to unworthy persons), saying, they are men of absolute$integrity! If to thee who hast thus attached thyself, integrity in those thine intimates$does not appear; hear, O thou who hast so attached thyself, it is as if one opened a$casket, thinking it contained an odorous unguent, and saw a snake within. 
Man cannot fathom other men's minds.$What single man has power to search and clearly know the inmost self of other men?$Lord of the land where weighty gems glisten on mountain slope, O hear ! — Men's$minds are otherwise, and otherwise their deeds.
Friends from self-interest$Lord of the flowery hilly land where streams wash out and carry hither and thither$(precious things) from the marshy land ! — The effusive friendship of those who do$not attach themselves (to us) in heart, but perform certain friendly acts merely to$strengthen their own position, and who form friendships guilefully, will issue in$disappointment to the minds (of those who are intimate with them). 
Ruin from unfitting intimacies.$If the glittering swords a man brandishes (be allowed to) fall into the hands of his$foes, it will assuredly come about that he will thus destroy also his own power of$action. So wealth (bestowed on the foolish) will go and burn up (merit accruing in)$both worlds, and therefore the really good thing is to keep clear of the foolish. 
To do good is life's gain.$O mind! thou leavest not the bonds of home. How many cycles, pray, with thou live$yearning still for children? Save the good he has done, however small its measure$may be, there is no true result to any living soul.
Learning, the only beauty.$Beauty of locks, beauty of circling garments' folds, beauty of saffron tint: these are$not beauty true. Integrity of soul that brings the conscience peace is learning's gift:$that only is beauty true
The remedy for bewilderment$Since in this world it yields fruit; since given it grows not less ; since it makes men$illustrious; since it perishes not as long as (its possessors) themselves exist; in any$world we see not any medicine that, like learning, removes the delusions of sense. 
The learned, though low-born, are first.$The excellent regard the salt produced in brackish ground is more valuable than the paddy$from fertile soil. It is fitting to place in the first rank the learned wise, though (sprung)$from the lowest origin. 
Learning, the best legacy.$It cannot be taken from its place of deposit; it does not perish anywhere by fire; if$kings of surpassing grandeur are angry they cannot take it away; (and therefore)$what any man should provide for his children as a legacy is learning. Other things are$not (real wealth)
Discriminating study.$Learning hath no bounds, the learners' days are few. If you think calmly diseases$many wait around! With clear discrimination learn what is meet for you, like the swan$that leaving the water drinks the milk
Never mind the boatman's caste if he take you over!$As none contemn the ferryman, by old caste rule to lowest rank assigned, but cross$the stream by help he lends; so take thou teachings good and wise by help of him$who is the learned man. 
The supreme enjoyment of the society of learned and amiable men.$We shall see whether any greater bliss is found in the city inhabited by the dwellers$in the ample heaven than is felt when men of natures formed by old imperishable$lore, from rivalries exempt keen as tempered steel, meet together and laugh. 
The friendship of the learned ever grows sweeter, that of the unlearned ever diminishes in sweetness.$Lord of the cool shore of the resounding sea intimacy with learned people is like$eating sugar cane from the (tender, juicy) tip; association with graceless. sapless$men is like leaving the (tender) tip and eating it from the (hard, dry) root. 
The benefits of association with the learned. The pot impregnated with odour.$Though themselves unlearned, if men live in association with the learned they$advance daily in excellent knowledge. The new vessel, by contact with the Padriflower of old renown and lustrous hue, imparts fragrance to the cold water it contains
Books of wisdom are the best. Others cannot remove confusion of mind.$If men leaving works of wisdom, that contain well-weighed instruction, unstudied,$devote themselves to the recitation of mere worldly literature, they will acquire a store$of empty high-sounding words, but not that wisdom by means of which mental$confusion (that treats unreal things as real) is removed.
In adversity noble men do not desert their principles.$Though their clothes may be old and their body worn with want, men of noble birth$diminish nothing of their due observances. Will the lion nibble the creeping grass$although sorest need should assail him?
The high-born only have perfect excellence, greatness, and good manners.$Lord of the hills traversed by clouds that touch the heavens! true excellence, and$dignity, and good conduct, — these three things belong to men of race that touches$heaven, and not to others, even though they may have acquired great wealth. 
The noble only have an instinctive sense of propriety. Rising from their seat (at the$approach of worshipful persons), going forth to meet them, departing when they$dismiss, and such - like things, the well born maintain as invariable decorum. The low$understand not one of these things.
Noble birth makes duty easy.$If men (of noble birth) do good things it is natural to them. As to evil things (to commit$these is impossible to them); for this would be guilt which many would bruit abroad.$What greater good then can accrue to men than high-birth, if it be their lot, to which$the perception of all (these things) belongs! 
These four pious fears exist only among the really worthy.$Dread of unlearned ignorance; dread of the work that base men do; dread of forgetful$slip in words which one must not utter; dread of not giving to those that ask: those$who are born of a race not so distinguished by conscientious fears are as trees. 
The fine qualities of the high-born.$Lord of the roaring salt-sea's cool shore, where gleam rare gems with pearls!$Association with the good, pleasant speech, a liberal hand, and purity of mind,$—all these are only found among the nobly born
High-born men do their duty always.$Though its frame-work has perished, and thronging white ants infest it, in a spacious$mansion some room will still afford shelter from the rain. Thus, although want annoys$them, the nobly born even yet will do what should be done. 
The moon when half in the serpent's mouth still gives light.$Like the moon which affords light to the fair and spacious earth with one side, while$the dragon holds the other, the nobly born do not become remiss in works of seemly$benevolence, though poverty (inability) stand fronting them.
The deer becomes not a charger.$Men of mean descent, even when all goes well with them, will not perform the good$deeds that the well-born will do, even when things do not go well with them.$Though the antelope should bear a pillion, it rushes not to war like the prancing charger. 
The noble even in poverty afford aid do those who seek it.$The nobly born, even when destitute, are props in time of feebleness to the needy$ones that draw nigh to them. So, when the wide river is dry, if you dig in its bed, forth$with clear waters gush out.
The good cannot endure a stain.$The moon that diffuses light through heaven's fair realms, and truly worthy men are$alike: yet that endures a spot, while the truly worthy endure it. not; — perplexed and$sad they pine away if but one stain appear. 
Aim high! Better miss a lion, than hit a jackal$Whether success attend, or do not attend the work, the excellent will even ponder$blameless ends.—Is the shaft that missed the lion worse than the arrow sent forth,$that with its impulse pierced the jackal's heart? 
The excellent are not led by want to commit evil.$The excellent though emaciated and poor, do not transgress the limits of virtue and$commit evil. With wisdom for the pillar, with perseverance as the band, they bind (the$mind); and as long as they live they do what it behoves them to do. 
The good never forget even a casual acquaintance.$Lord of the land of goodly hills ! —If trodden for a few days a path is formed over$even the craggy hill; so excellent persons, though they have seen (worthy) men only$for one day, as they were travelling, will bind them to their soul, exhibiting all the$marks of an ancient friendship. 
The good listen with patient courtesy to the orations of the ignorant.$Even when one speaks who has an ungrammatical knowledge of the letter, but not of$the meaning who is of a low (empty) school, and is unlearned the good with kindly$compassion will listen, though it is pain to them, being grieved that he should be put$to shame in the presence of many. 
Sugar-cane, crush it as you will, is ever sweet.$Although you bite the sugar-cane, crush it till its joints are broken, grind it, and$express its juice, it still will be sweet. The highly born, even when men have passed$by abusing them so as to wound, never lose their self-respect so as to utter from their$mouth (words of abuse). 
The wise free from gross evils.$They defraud not, drink not palm-wine, shun what is forbidden, never despise and$speak contemptuously of their neighbours, nor even forgetfully do they utter anything$untrue with their mouth : these men of faultless vision grieve not though they fall into distress
When a man should be deaf, blind, and dumb.$Deaf to others' secrets, blind to his neighbour's wife, dumb to evil backbiting—if,$knowing what is befitting, a man thus abides, it is not necessary to teach him any virtuous precepts. 
Seek the good they are always kind.$They who are destitute of kindly courtesy, even after the lapse of many days, will$contemn (those that visit them), saying, ‘they will ask something of us'. The excellent$will treat them with distinction whenever they see them, saying, ‘if they ask something$of us, it is well'. 
The treasure cave.$The lowest sort of men say, there are men of property,’— cling to them steadily,$follow them, and so flourish. Is it not as when a mine of treasure has been found,$when men of good lineage have become our friends.
It is difficult to regain the forfeited favour of good men.$Lord of the pleasant land whose hills resounding water-falls adorn ! — You may not$even to faultless men do things that enkindle wrath; for when their wrath is once$kindled, it is hard for any one to change their mood. 
Waste of golden opportunities.$Although those whose (pretended) wisdom is without moral excellence have gained$access to men to whom approach is difficult even by gifts of gold alas! they pass$away (the precious moments) as mere waste time
Praise and dispraise of noble persons only of importance.$Both disesteem and thorough esteem are in the class of things that depend on the$estimation of the great. Those who have a discriminating knowledge of true science,$lay no stress on either the abuse or the fulsome praise of man who comprehend not$moral principles, and know not the rules of propriety. 
None safe from the wrath of the great.$The serpent rich of hue, though it dwell in the mountain-cleft, from far is frighted by$the thunderbolt's fierce wrath; so men escape not though hid in strongholds hard to$reach, when those great in virtue are wroth. 
Self-praise is no commendation.$‘You know not all our worth, for equals have we none:’ when self thus estimates$itself, this is not ‘esteem’ ! When perfect men, proficients in virtue, regard any as$dear, and esteem them as great, this is ‘esteem’ ! 
Morning and evening shadows.$Lord of the great sea’scool margin !—Friendships formed with mean men dwindling$die like shadows of the morn; friendship of men of old renown as shadows of the$after-day will lengthen out and grow
To those who cultivate them fruits accrue.$Those who press their suit, fitness a part, enjoy the wealth of kings, and the charms$of maidens fair; so all the cool (shady) trees that droop earthward with thick foliage,$give room to those that thronging seek their shelter. 
Friendship brings pangs of severance.$Severance from even those who have no under standing [lit. no understanding that$understands (so as) to understand] causes great and spreading sorrow. — Lord of$the shore of the great, unfailing, swelling bay !—To be intimate with none is ten$million times the best.
No day unimproved.$Days gone by without learning, those passed without any intercourse with the great,$those spent without giving what is fitting;— in the case of the excellent, if you tell$them over, none such occur. 
Humility. Self-restraint. Charity.$The greatness of the great is [the quality of littleness (in their own sight), i. e.]$humility; the (real) acquisition of those who have acquired (any). one (science) is$modest self-restraint. If you rightly understand things, those possessors of wealth$only are really wealthy who relieve the wants of those that approach them (as suppliants).
Good companionship cures the follies of youth.$In youth unwise, though men consort with haughty ones and walk in lawless ways;$yet, when they join with those that know the righteous path, their faults shall melt$away as dew from off the grass when sunbeams scorch. 
Six precepts.$Know virtue's path ! Dread death! Beat others' words severe! Beware ye practise no$deceit! Friendship detest with men of evil deeds! Daily get gain of words that fall from$greatmen's lips! 
Life has many evils. Attach yourself to the wise.$Severance of close-joined friends and sore disease and death, all these combined$hap to those that have assumed a human body: so the truly wise have felt that birth,$from the very first, is bitterness. Ah! soul, cleave close to these!
Friendship makes life endurable.$Though when you ponder it, it is surpassing: bitterness, none hate (this mortal) birth,$if in (this mortal) birth they ever perform friendly acts to men whose hearts are set on$noble excellence, and gain their friendship. 
The water from the sewer becomes a sacred stream.$When water from the town-sewers has joined the great river its very name is$changed, and it becomes a 'sacred stream’. Ponder well! Even those who have no$greatness of clan, if they ally themselves with good men of goodly fame, shall stand$firm as a hill.
The hare in the moon is worshipped.$Because it is in the bright-beamed moon the very hare in heaven's lofty fair expanse$is worshipped. Though scant their worthiness, men obtain worth who share friendship$with those firm as a hill. 
Water with milk seems milk.$Commingled with milk water becomes milk; at least, it shows no more as water by its hue.$Look close, the mean men's meanness shows not if they join themselves to$greatness of the good and great.
The society of the good a protection.$Grass close around the stump in the field adjoining the house will not be destroyed$by the ploughshare of the farmer ; [thus] though men are weak, if they get under safe$protection, the wrath of their foes will not reach them.
Good tribal associations maintain excellence, and evil ones wreck it.$As rice that flourishes through the goodness of the soil, good men become illustrious$by the excellence of their respective clanships.$Goodness perishes when it comes near evil associates, as the tornado advances$and destroys the excellence of the ship. 
Evil association brings ruin.$Though themselves pure in mind, even good men incur contempt because of their$associations. So in the woodland glade when a conflagration takes place (not the$worthless brushWood only, but) the fragrant Sandal and Vengai too are consumed. 
Renunciation of desire is ‘greatness.'$To give is no longer ours; and youth is gone far off ; our once beloved ones think of$us no more! To depart, having abandoned 'desire' that bids us love and hope for$future joys, appears the thing that's meet. 
Fools make their home in a changing world.$Fools thinking 'we have found joy in the refuge of home,' and 'we are here in perfect$repose, forgetful (of the instability of all things), go on their way.$Those who have felt that 'refuge' is unstable, while it seems to stand fast, never fix$their fond desire (on it). 
Seek the unchanging. All things here change.$See that ye sow seed that in other world may germinate; free your lives from earth's$bewilder-ment and meanness ; stand in your lot as wise men; the changing hue of$things shall without cause fade, and many things be new
Good men are unfailing fountains of beneficence.$The well of springing water serves the town that draws and drinks, even in time when$rains are scant; so great men in adverse hour dispense due gifts that others give not$even in their best estate. 
Great men do not neglect dutiesbecause of poverty.$The river pours forth a mighty stream and feeds the world; and when it is dried up, if$men dig in its bed, streams gush out! So good men when rich, give to many; and,$when ruined, give still at least to some, and do what should be done.
Faults are conspicuous in great persons.$Lord of the lofty hills! Any evil in men of moral greatness shows like a brand on a$mighty bull; but although mean men do painful deeds, like the slaughter of that same$mighty bull, none of these attracts attention
Enmity of the wise better than friendship of the mean.$In proportion to the degree of one's intimacy with men essentially mean and without$good qualities sorrow accrues; but even the hostility of those who do not desire$forbidden things even in jest will confer dignity. 
Be all things to all men.$With gentle fair ones use gentleness surpassing theirs; with foes display a wrath that$death's self might dread; with persistent men show a persistency to match ; amongst$men of good do good; let the law of life be thus laid down. 
The great men is unmoved amid insults.$These are the pure in heart who, though any vex, and with use of slanderous words$would fain perplex them, with calm unruffled mind abide unwavering, like the bright$flame within the lamp.
Feeding the hungry.$The excellent will daily give to the needy in charity their first-served food; they$themselves will eat what is served after: such good conduct removes the three faults,$and from sorrow sets men free, through all the days, till comes the end. 
Active independence.$As for kindred that feed upon what relatives give them they will die off like green$grain below a tank, which does not hold a sufficient supply (of water).$Is failure possible to men of energy that are quick in movement as the eyes of those$who perform the sword-dance ? 
By energy a man makes himself.$What once stood by the wayside, a twig that bent to every touch, when its core is$developed within, may become a stake to which they tie an elephant. Life too is thus,$if man himself, unfailing make himself !
Stoop to conquer.$The huge tiger, when lacking flesh for food one day, may even seize a little frog and$eat it. Think not 'By (all my) knowledge I only gain menial tasks;" to the skillful hand$nobler employments shall even there abound. 
Manliness is perseverance in spite of failure.$Manliness is working on, in no wise faltering, remaining stedfast though the matter$succeed not. When all is successful,— Lord of the cool lovely shore, in whose groves$the waves agitate the scented thorn, — will not even women live and flourish? 
What is good or bad caste ?$When men speak of 'good caste' and 'bad caste' it is a mere form of speech, and has$no real meaning. Not even by possessions, made splendid by ancient glories, but by$self-denial, learning, and energy is Caste determined. 
Reserve as to your own plans, and skill in detecting those of others.$Till the time for action comes men of understanding keep close within themselves$their wisdom and speak not of their designs.$The world is subject to the nod of the brilliant (diplomatists) who search out (and$know) men's designs from outward indications (lit. from) their members, i.e. from eye,$gesture, tone, expression etc.). 
The worthy son conceals his sire's defects, and sustains his weakness.$If the banyan's trunk be eaten by the gnawing ant, its 'branch root' bears it up, like a$buttress; even so, when decay appears in the sire, the son he has begotten shall$hide it, and weakness is no more. 
Poverty but not dishonour.$The lion's pointed claw and mighty foot will wound the spotted face of an elephant;$those who have power like his , — though bereft of all, they die in want within their$home, — will they do deeds that bring disgrace?
High birth useless without lofty energies.$Like the flowers on a rounded stalk, with hair like filaments that sweet cane bare,$when the sweet fragrance they breathed is lost, what gain accrues from birth in a$lofty noble house when energy that makes the name noteworthy, is wanting? 
The scant fare of the laborious is the diet of the gods.$The base feed full of rice and savoury food, that men, great lords of the triple lands,$with generous gladness give; but water won with willing strenuous toil by those who$know, not savoury food by name even, will turn to nectar.
As a mother when she sees her son upon her lap forgets the languors, the pains, and$the throes of birth; so trouble arising from weakness will die when a man sees his$sympathizing kinsmen around him. 
Good friends like trees that afford both shade and fruit.$To yield ready protection alike to all, as a tree affords shade to those that seek its$shelter when the heat grows fierce; and to live toiling so that many may enjoy the$gain, resembling thus a fruit producing tree, is the duty of the manly man. 
The magnanimous never refuse to support their kindred. The bough sustains all its$fruits.$Lord of the land where mountains piled on mountains rise! the great demur not to$support their kith and kin ;—there is no bough but will support the fruit it bears,$though clustered thick great fruits and many cling thereon. 
The friendship of the great alone is lasting.$Though mingled in a complete intimacy so that all the world knows of it, the$friendship of the little will last but little time. Connection with the firm unyielding men$endures till the great one's path, who never swerve, is reached. 
Universal benevolence.$‘Such are they and so many;’ ‘these are ours; those strange :’ those worthy to be$classed as chief of men say nothing like this ; so to speak is not their nature ; for they$relieve the distress of ALL that troubled come to them!
Hard fare with kindred, better than a feast without love.$More sweet than rice, though white as tiger's claw with milk and sugar served on$plate of gold, by loveless hands, is any tasteless mess, in any dish, when shared with$kindred dear as life. 
Any food with foes bitter, with friends sweet.$Most bitter (Margosa) is the bounteous meal of dainty food at early dawn in house of$those who love us not. Hear thou! though not till evening given, the mess of herbs$when eaten with our own is sweet.
Interested and disinterested friends.$Even those who, like the artificer's small hammer (with slight strokes fashioning the$jewel), gently, day by day, moulding their patron to their will, eat his food,$will drop him (when poverty assails him), as the pincers do the gold put into the$crucible. Those worthy to be called friends are like the artificer's rod which enters the$fire with it. 
Sympathy in sorrow and in joy.$O maid adorned with fresh garlands of fragrant flowers! is there one thing that even$in other world, friends may perform for friends, if till they die, their joys they share, but$shun to share their griefs ? 
Better fast with friends than feast with foes.$The savoury fried curry, (in colour) like a cat's eye, which one eats seated a part in$the house of those who are without affection, will be bitter as margosa; but cold gruel$(weak and insipid), like clear water, in the house of affectionate equals, is ambrosia$that cleaves to the bones. 
Satisfying friendships.$Intimacy with those who understand the real intention (of one's words), and who have$acquired wisdom by learning, will at all times be like eating sweet cane from the$tender shoots; but attachment to those who have no sweetness of disposition is like$eating it in a direction opposite to the tender shoot (it grows harder and less sweet). 
Examine the lineage of a candidate for your friendship.$Lord of the land of flowery hills, where wild-fowl golden in hue fly, scared by the rush$of the waterfall.$Regarding the mobility of their birth—these will not swerve:—To say thus is a good$ground of confidence—(a good position to take up); but to say ‘their minds are$known,' is not any (i. e. real ground). 
The elephant and the dog, types of false and true friends.$Forsaking friendship with those who resemble the elephant, embrace and hold fast$intimacy with those who are like the dog; for the elephant will slay even its keeper$though it has long known him ; but the dog will wag its tail when it has in its body the$javelin (hurled at it by its angry master). 
Friends are not to be forsaken because long severed$Though men dwell side by side for many days when their souls cleave not (are not$congenial) for even a few days they retain not their friendship. But is it possible to let$go attachment's well-knit ties, though those to whom one's soul is knit dwell many days afar? 
Tree-flowers and water-flowers.$The use and wont of friendship is that, what once it has loved it loves always,— like$the flower on the tree-branch which having once unfolded afterwards closes not; but$who will esteem, or make friends of those who are like flowers on the surface of the$excavated tank, which unfold and afterwards close themselves? 
Three grades of friends.$The lowest sort of men in friendship are like the Arecanut tree. The middle sort are$like the cocoa-nut tree. Attachments to the chief of men — who are old friends —is$like the Palmyra tree of rare worth : what was given that first day was given once for all. 
A dinner of herbs with affection is ambrosia. The greatest delicacies without it, nux vomica.$If one receive you courteously, though what he gives is but rank herbs dressed in$water in which rice had been washed, it is ambrosia. To eat from the hands of those$who love us not, though it be white rice with rich spicy condiments, is nux vomica. 
Friendship of those who though near aid not.$Of what value is the friendship of those who being very near like the little claw on a$dog's leg, afford not help as much as a fly's foot? Though you go far to seek it, lay$hold of the friendship of those who are like the water channel that causes the crops in$the field to flourish. 
Four bad things.$Better hate than friendship of the ignorant. Better death than disease which comes$on yielding to no remedy. Sweeter is killing thin contempt that breaks the spirit. Better$abuse than undeserved praise
Never forsake a friend!$When men have formed an intimacy separation afterwards even from a snake$which slays with its tooth, causes affliction therefore associate$intimately with many, and for many days take them to your bosom, conform to their$tastes and habits, and hold fast the really worthy ones
Bear with infirmities. None are perfect.$When those to whom with strong desire we clung as good, prove otherwise, keep the$sad secret bid, - cling to them still! The growing grain has husks; the water has its$foam: flowers too have scentless outer sheath of leaves. 
Bear with your friends' faults, as the cultivator bears with the stream that often bursts its enclosure.$If though they dam it up, the fresh flood should burst its bonds, men do not feel$aggrieved; but straightway imprison it again, for by the precious stream they live: so$though their friends again and again do very disagreeable things, men bear with$those whose friendship is dear. 
Bear all things!$Lord of the lofty hilly land, where the bees hum through all the flowery Gongu-glade!$— Though friends should work us surpassing ills, the only thing that is meet is$forbearance: patience of one is friendship of the twain. 
To be wroth with those we love, is like fire in the breast!$Lord of the shore where pearls of purest lustre are thrown up by circling waves, and$where swift darting boats are borne through the surf !—when friends who we may not$leave have alien hearts, it is as a scorching fire enkindled in the soul. 
Forsake not friends though they wrong you.$Though those, from whom you may not part, do grievous things, O maid who art as$Lakshmi! you must still cherish your chosen friends—fire destroys men's wealth and$happy homes, yet is it sought there and kindled every day. 
Friends are not to be forsaken on account of their faults.$When those from whom it is hard to part do evil things should men at once renounce the$—Lord of the lengthening hills that pierce the sky, whence rarest gifts descend$!—Do men cut off their hand because it pricked their eye? 
Those who forsake friends that have committed a fault are worse than they.$Lord of the cool shore of the shining sea! The perfect ones when they have$contracted an intimacy with any, see no faults in them, even if they do things that$cause pain. Those who, being without stable wisdom, take up and tell out men's evil$deeds after contracting an intimacy with them, are themselves worse than they. 
Faults in strangers and in friends$Lord of the land of resounding waterfalls! Though what those alien to us have done$may be surpassingly evil, what is there to be pained at, when you regard it?$Things done by affectionate friends, will be excellent when so regarded by the mind.
If friends prove unfaithful, love them the more, and keep the secret of their$unfaithfulness in your own bosom.$If we perceive those we have accepted as our own to be not really ours, we must pay$even more respect to them than to our own, and keep concealed in our own mind the$fact that they are not really ours. 
He who pries into his friends faults shares the punishment of the revealer of secrets.$If, after I have taken a man for my friend, I go about prying into his faults and virtues$(other qualities), may I depart whither that man goes who has not kept his friend's$secret, while the earth, begirt by the resounding sea, laughs.
Unreal friends cling to you till they have gained their desire.$Lord of the pleasant well-watered mountain land, where boiling waterfalls pour down$from the dark hills! (Poor men) linger beneath the old roof that affords no shelter,$baling out the water, and making mud embankments, and enduring the down-pour;$(even so unreal friends stick by you) till their purpose has been attained. 
The friendship of the excellent like rain ; of others like drought.$Lord of the land of pure (white, forming) waterfalls! The friendship of the virtuous is of exceeding excellence, and yields glorious results — like (seasonable) rain; but the friendship of the vicious, even in the time of its exuberance, is as when the rain fails in the time of drought. 
Bliss enjoyed with the wise is heaven; association with the ignorant and worthless is hell.$Enjoyment of the society of men of refinement resembles the heavenly world in the pleasure it affords. Closest contact with those destitute of fine perception of the value$of learned pursuits —men who gain no wisdom from you, nor you from them—is one of the hells. 
Intimacy with those who have no sympathy is like fire in the stubble.$Lord of the land where wide groves of Sandal cover the hilly slopes! Friendship with those who feel not its real obligation, like fire in the straw (suddenly) appears,$seeming as though it would increase, but never advancing dies out. 
Boastings and delays.$The promising to do what cannot be done, and the putting off and leaving undone$through delay things that could be done, will forthwith bring experience of sorrow$even to those who have condemned truthfully the pleasant experiences of life (ascetics and saints). 
The water-lily does not become a lotus by being in the same tank with it: so evil$persons will act in conformity with their natures.$The Ambal (water-lily) does not equal the expanding Kuvalai though born and growing$together with it in the same pool : though they attain to intimacy with those of$generous instincts, the deeds of men in whom these instincts are lacking will be diverse. 
Friendship with the uncongenial is bad.$Lord of the hilly land where the immature little monkey, with its finger like a bean-pod,$will flip its father when it meets him, and poke him and snatch fruit from him! Afflictive$indeed is friendship with the uncongenial. 
The curse of him who does not offer his life for his friend.$If I hasten not to put forth my hand and offer my precious life to my friend when in$distress, may I depart whither he goes who has violated the sanctity of his friend's$wedded wife, while the far-famed world laughs! 
Bitter for sweet.$Lord of the land of goodly hills where honey flows! To forsake the friendship of those$who know the right, and cultivate that of shallow pretenders to knowledge, is like$emptying out cow's ghee from a vessel and pouring into it margosa oil. 
A specious outward appearance without a liberal spirit$The absence of generosity in those whose exterior is pleasing, is like the mingling of$water with the milk provided for food: when men of understanding take to bad$company it is like the disporting of a Cobra with a female viper.
Generosity to fallen foes.$Worthy men, when they behold where foes are foiled, themselves too feel sore$abashed, and do not hasten on to crush them. Behold, the strong invulnerable$dragon draws not near the moon (to swallow it) when it is in its tender crescent days! 
Self-restraint, an ornament.$Lord of the cool shore of the spreading sea ! To men in poverty a modest selfrestraint is the chiefest ornament. If a man live in unbending pride, and in a manner$unbefitting his position, his fellow-townsmen will revile his race. 
Character, not birthplace.$Whatever soil you sow it in, the Strychnos nut grows not into a cocoa-palm. Some of$the Southern land have entered Paradise! It is man's way of life that decides his$future state. Full many from the Northern land are denizens of hell. 
Good men not affected by corrupt influences.$Though ripened amid margosa leaves the fruit of the plantain loses no atom of its$sweet flavour. Even so the friendship of men of noble mood, although their race be$evil, can hardly work ill to the mind. 
Not environment, but mind makes the man.$Though close by the sea, sweet waters oft-times spring up there; on the hill-side the$waters often gush out all brine! Thus men are not as their race. — Lord of the$dashing sea's cool shore! Men are as their minds. 
Against caprice.$Lord of the cool sea-shore, where flourishes the thick-stemmed laurel !$Men whose minds are good (constant), and who adhere to whomsoever they have formed an$intimacy with, will not sometimes avoid men, and at other times be intimate.$It is good not to have fits of alternating warmth and indifference. 
Good and bad associations.$Join the men who throughly feel true wisdom's inner sense, and forthwith joy joins you.$Join yourself to men devoid of the accurate preception of knowledge, and then$parting from them is parting from pain. 
Men makes, unmakes, and ennobles himself.$He that establishes a man in good, and he that disturbs that good position and casts$him down, and he that more and more exalts a man and establishes him, and he that$makes a man head (among men) is (the MAN) HIMSELF.
It is prudent sometimes to sacrifice pride.$Lord of the cool shore of the sounding sea, where from old time the billows roar!—$In the course of their affairs when even great men follow after the unlearned, this is not folly but wisdom. 
A perfect life-voyage.$If a man has wrought all fitting works, enjoyed all seemly pleasures, done deeds of$charity to worthy men: if he shall have accomplished all these three unchecked, in$this one state, of him men will say: ‘that is a ship that has gained the haren'
Lack of accurate perception is poverty. Mere externals are nothing.$The want of refined knowledge is poverty, its possession is very great and abundant$wealth. When one considers, will not a sexless creature, more woman than man,$adorn herself with the jewels that her eye desires ? 
Why the goddess Fortuna avoids the learned.$Men of vast and varied lore are seen in low estate, and suffer want. Would you know$the reason? The anciently renowned ‘Lady of the tongue' abides with them). ‘The$Lady of the flowers' is jealous, and draws not near !
Folly of refusing to learn in youth.$He who, when his father urgently bade him learn, did not take it as a serious matter,$but contemned it; when, before many men, some one gently presents a written palmleaf, will in anger fetch a stick to beat him as guilty of an insult. 
An ignorant man is a mere cur!$When a man who has grown up without learning enters the society of the wise, if he$sit still, it is as if a dog sat there; and if he rise to speak, it is as though a dog barked. 
Cast not pearls before swine.$All the baser sort consorting with scholars of a heterodox and low school, will utter$illiterate rubbish; but men replete with learning, though urgently asked, utter not the$results of their learning, knowing that (the asker) would fail to apply their minds to the$import of what was said. 
Modest silence.$Men of learned tongues are silent, fearing some slip; others (ignorant men) will speak$out; on the Palmyra tree the dried-up leaves make a loud rustling noise ; but$evermore the green leaf gives forth no sound ! 
Good instruction thrown away on thankless people.$When you expound the way of virtue to ungrateful people, —which is like mashing up$sweet mangoes for a pig in a food — trough , — those virtuous teachings lose all$their force —have their point broken by the obtuseness of the$disciple— and do not enter into, or suit his ear, — like a stake which one would drive$in on the side of a hill.
Learning requires discipline.$Though you wash it with milk for many days and dry it, charcoal on no hypothesis$becomes white ! So into the undisciplined body wisdom enters not, though you teach$it, driving it in with a stick.
The fly desires not the fragrant honey. The base esteem not sweet and powerful words.$To those whose minds are full of foul things, — like the fly which goes not to feed on$the flower that pours forth sweetness and breathes perfume, but fixes its eager$desire on ordure,—What clear comprehension can there be of the lucid words full of$honied sweetness that issue from the mouths of the worthy? 
The base man rejects the words of the learned, and seeks the assembly of congenial fools.$The base man does not apprehend the faultless words of accurate instruction which$the learned utter. These pain his mind. He therefore looks in the face of some other$one like himself (for encouragement), and convenes a wretched assembly of his own:$i.e. He finds one like-minded, and the two set up a sect.
Useless neighbours : so near and yet so far.$The bat approaches not the Heronia, with its dry stem, though it be night at hand and$bear abundant fruit; so although mean people are very close at hand, their wealth is$not a thing that can be counted upon. 
None pluck the Kalli flowers. The wise approach not the base.$Men reach not out their band to the Kalli (Cactus), though it bears delicate round$buds by the handful, because these are not flowers they can weave into a garland to$crown themselves withal; so wise people from no friendships with the base however$great their wealth may be. 
Though living on the sea-shore, men go to the fresh spring to drink.$Though men live on the curved shore of the sea with its multitudinous waves, they go$and drink at the well, with its perennial fountain of fresh water from the rock; so even$if those (who are neighbours) are very wealthy, the desire (of the poor) is towards the$liberal, though these may be far to seek. 
The senseless dressed in silks! Virtue quite another matter.$In the world surrounded by the (all-)embracing sea, merit is quite an indifferent matter!$Understanding ones are (poor); and even those of no understanding—$who are like mere palm tree tufts and brinjals—live prosperously, clad in silks and rich garments. 
Men fortunate who seem not to deserve it.$While pleasant folk and just abide (in poverty), you ponder why men unjust and$ignorant have any joy. It is fruit of 'ancient deeds', thou whose long eyes are darts :—$to thoughtful mind no other cause occurs.
Fortune cursed.$O golden dame, that sittest like a scentless leaf on a beauteous flower! Die, and fall$in ashes to the ground: thou enterest homes of worthless men of perverse mind,$forsaking good men pure as gold.
Poverty with the good, and prosperity with the mean.$Has poverty, that bides with men of righteous souls, no shame? Does wealth to$ungenerous men stick like glue?O thou of dart-like eye, with wonder see that thus, no$just discernment made, these two abide ! 
The self-dying and the self-indulgent.$Men who are not void of shame will travel forth on foot, and feed on scraps, —$so pass their days ; the shameless ones make no journeys on foot, but feed on dainties$at home, perspiring over the feast. 
Misplaced liberality; rain on the sea.$While the red paddy's golden germ is parched within the ear and dies, the cloud$gleaming with lightnings pours forth its treasures on the sea. When silly men gain$ample wealth, even so are their liberal gifts bestowed ! 
The unintelligent never learn; the intelligent perceive without learning.$Men void of understanding, though they learn, learn not!$Men of understanding, though unlearned, are as men learned!$They are rich, though utter paupers, who never beg;$the rich are paupers if they bestow nothing!
Share your food with friends and foes. To the selfish heaven's gate is closed.$To eat your own meal, after sharing what you have cooked, to the extent of your$ability, both with those who are friends and those who are not friends, is 'cooking and$eating' (= is real house keeping). To the good-for-nothing human beings whose habit$of life it is to shut themselves up and eat alone what they have cooked, the door of$yonder world will be shut. 
Give what you can, when you can.$Whatever the measure be, those who do even lesser acts of charity to the measure$of their power shall attain to excellence. But those who, when they have obtained$great wealth. say 'we will be wise (and give) by and by,' are lost in a sea of guilt. 
The miser contemptible.$The senseless man who spends not time in enjoyment (of his wealth), and who gives$nothing to pions devotees, but hoards and dies, —him his hoarded wealth derides;$him all that is gracious in the world derides. 
The miser loses what he hoards.$The great wealth obtained by the man of straitened soul, who knows not how either$to give or to enjoy, shall be enjoyed by a stranger, in due season—like lovely virgins$remaining unmarried in the dwelling. 
Poverty better than the wealth of those who live for this world alone.$Though they have got the mighty sea with its dashing waves (to drink from), men wait$for the stream slowly issuing from the little well, often dry, and drink there; so the$exceeding poverty of the virtuous is preferable to the wealth of those who know not of$the world to come.
Whose is the miser's wealth?$As to the property which the wretched churl claims saying 'It is mine, it is mine ,' I too$chime in with "It is mine, it is mine;' for if it is his, he himself spends it not, nor enjoys$the benefit of it; and I, too, neither spend nor enjoy it! 
Poor men better off than churls.$The poor have escaped much from which rich men that dispense not suffer.$They have escaped the reputation of having lost (their substance). They have escaped the$toil of saving it. They have escaped (the labour of) digging (to hide it). They have$escaped the ache of hands securing it from powerful plunderers. Many are the$(sorrows) they have escaped. 
Nothing but his own churlishness hinders the churl from being liberal.$While it was his he gave not; and his heirs, how it is theirs, give not. Before, while it$was his, if he had given, they would not have reproved (him); and afterwards, if they$had given, he would not have reproved them! Men's own avarice is the sole reason$for the lack of charity. 
Those wanting in liberal instinct give only on compulsion.$Liberality is that which yields its gifts spontaneously (from good instinct), the askers$being as the calf and the givers as the cow; meanness yields only when put into a$strait and forced, as a cow with no good instinct gives a scanty supply when$strong ones press. 
Wealth is the source of many sorrows.$Gathering it together is trouble, and even so the guarding of resplendent wealth is$severe trouble. If the guarded heap diminish, it is trouble. If it perish, it is trouble.$Wealth is trouble's very dwelling-place! 
Money commands respect.$Though he wraps a cloth dyed red around his loins, a dozen coins or so, will gain (the$wretch) respect among many men! The man devoid of wealth, though born of noble$race, is viler (in the world's estimation) than a lifeless corpse !
The insinuating mendicant.$Where water cannot enter! the more insinuating ghi glides in; and smoke as a subtler$power to penetrate than even ghi. If you look into it, the man debased by poverty will$enter haunts where smoke scarce finds a way. 
All abandon the needy.$When on the high hill's crags the Kanthal blooms no more, the crimson-spotted$beetle tribe seek not its boughs;—Lord of the hills wherefrom they scare parrots with$stones! — the needy have no kin. 
Time-serving friends.$When wealth is there, obsequious myriads will assemble, like crows around the fallen$corpse. When wealth, as the beetle wheels its flight, is gone, no one in all the world$will ask, ‘Is it well with you?'
Nothing benefits the poor man.$Lord of the pleasant land of clustering hills whose crags are washed by sounding$waterfalls !—Their race is nought, their manly prowess is nought, their rare learning$is nought, when men are held in poverty's embrace. 
Let the churl become a guest of others!$Although he dwells within the village, and sees the poor draw nigh with hungry soul$desiring aid, he yields them none : why then in the village does he vainly pass his$days? It were better he went to be a guest himself ! 
Poverty ruins all.$O thou whose teeth vie in sharpness with jasmine buds! — When sharp distress of$poverty assails, men lose all their attributes of goodness at once, with the mind's$acuteness gained from amplest stores of wisdom. 
The struggle with want.$Better indeed is the life that pertains to the ruinous course, that going$far away, stretches out (supplicating) hand at every door, than to dwell at$home toiling, subject to obstacles. not giving aught$to those that ask, because of straitened circumstances. 
Reverses.$The hands once loaded with golden bracelets now cull the forest-herb and cook the$meal; and then eat the mess unseasoned, from the palm-leaf for a dish! Thus sad at$heart they live, when fortune is gone and ruin come. 
Interested friends.$The humming spotted beetle tribes all bright in hue gather not on the branch that has$ceased to blow. Lord of the good cool hilly land, of high renown, whence bounteous$streams flow down unceasingly—the unprosperous have no kin!
Honourable minds are wroth with wealthy arrogance.$The mind of those possessed of honourable feeling will kindle into flame, like the fire$that has caught the forest when the conflagration rages, whenever they behold the$haughty acts of those who are destitute of virtuous habits, and to whom their wealth$is their only strength. 
High-minded men complain not to the unsympathizing.$Will (honourable men who are) 'masters of themselves' follow graceless men to tell of$their sufferings, tbough fallen away to mere skeletons ? Do they not (rather) tell the$pain they have felt to those enlightened souls that understand their sufferings before they speak ? 
Dependence on the wealthy destroys self-respect.$As for ourselves we would introduce them (these friends) to our household : but as$regards them, they are ashamed (of us), as though they said, as soon as they (the$ladies) saw them (the friends,) it would be the destruction of their womanly reserve;$and so they seat us at the backdoor and give us rice! Therefore let us dismiss all$thought of rich men's friendship. 
The law of honour is that maintained by honourable men.$O thou whose locks diffuse the odour of pleasant musk! Behold, especially good is (it$to cultivate) that which is esteemed by men of honourable mind; for in this world it is$(obviously) good : and, since it leads to perseverance in the way of virtue, it will yield$good things in yonder world also. 
Dishonour worse than death.$The men 'fulfilled of excellence,' though death were the alternative, do not deeds that$entail sin and guilt. Death is an affliction for one day, and for a little while. There is$nothing that works irreparable ill like those (deeds). 
The wealthy and the poor.$Poor are the men that give not, even though deemed wealthiest of all that flourish on$the teeming apple earth! They who even when they are poor seek not as suppliants$wealthy men are 'Lords of the three mighty lands.' 
The honourable dread most the loss of reputation.$Thou who hast long dart-like eyes with eye-brows extending far, like a bow! the$lowest class of men dread burning hunger; the other (or middle class) dread what is$unpleasant; all the chief of men fear words that impute crime. 
The rich man's contemptuous pity.$When the very worthy and thoroughly learned see the rich men's glance of$disparagement, as they say contemptuously, 'These are good people —persons in$greatly reduced circumstances—poor folks,' does not their mind kindle into flame$within them, like the fire by the breath of the bellows on the blacksmith's forge?
What is dishonouring.$It is no shame (disgrace) not to (be able to give to those who desire it of us. The$shrinking on account of fear (felt) day by day is not shame (modesty). But to become$reduced in other ways, and not to [dare to] tell what injuries those who love us not$have inflicted on us is shame (disgrace, or self-respect). 
Heaven itself must not be sought at the expense of honour$The jungle-haunting tiger that slays the wild cow, refuses to eat and passes by what$has fallen (of itself) in its path (i. e. carrion); so the excellent, though the wide realms$of heaven were within their reach, would not desire them, if to be obtained (only) by$the loss of honour.
Ignorant condescending patrons.$Will men themselves possessed of clear discerning knowledge follow after those who$have yielded themselves up to mental bewilderment, and who (erroneously) say (of$suppliants), ‘These poor folks depend entirely on us, evermore are they without$resources in themselves?'
Honest hunger and dishonest fulness of food.$Is not a man's dying and birth again measured by the twinkling of an eye? Is it then a$fault if a man rather choose to suffer hunger, doing no blameworthy actions, than to$feed full, doing things that entail disgrace ? 
Ask only of the courteous.$There will never be wanting those who, with their destitution as their support (making$it their excuse), will venture upon mendicancy, and tread the way of humiliation; but$will the noble-minded man enter (as a suppliant) the presence of any save of those$who will embrace him and say, 'Enter my dwelling, eat of my food ?'
No reverses bend the noble spirit.$Though fortune forsake him, and fate frown, the man of lofty soul, dwelling with$steadfast mind on things above, disdains to stand with bending neck in the train of$the foolish who hoard their wealth.
Mendicancy is always painful.$To live asking naught even from those dear as an eye, whose love is sure, and who$never refuse, is happy life. Since the mind dissolves in shame at the very thought of$beggary,— when men receive alms, what are the receivers' thoughts, I pray ? 
Contentment better than mendicancy.$When a man himself, begs of himself, saying, ‘Let troubles come, let joys depart!' the$sting of poverty is extracted; why then, for this purpose, should any one, his mind$agitated with desire, and his eye wasted with weeping, beg of strangers ? 
Beggars are universally despised.$Lord of the land where gold is borne down by rushing waterfalls from every hilly slope!$— Though in this world new (kinds of) men are continually born, that very man$is never born that does not scorn mendicants. 
Mendicancy is unmitigated misery.$Want wastes his outward frame; he lays aside wisdom, his inward being's good; and$so resolving, begs of some stranger, saying, 'Give to me.’— If then the boon be$refused, must he not that very instant die? 
A hermitage preferable to mendicancy.$Men form close intimacies with others and live as their dependants, and this is$permissible ; but is it more painful quietly to go one's way (to the hermitage) than, lost$to all sense of personal dignity, to say, 'Will ye not do aught for me?’
Relieve the wants of old friendsthough they shrink from it.$Relying on old friendship, in an affectionate manner, render such assistance as your intimacy warrants.$If he will not endure (the assistance), will it not be a fire heaped$up and burning in his bosom?
Cast not pearls before swine.$Decline entirely to utter words of wisdom before men of darkened knowledge (men who professing to be wise, have their understanding$darkened), who having forsaken the way pertaining to the assemblies of true wisdom,$have there laid down propositions of unwisdom, and propagating them diligently, live$in accordance with their own shallow wisdom! 
Avoid the angry violent disputant.$Well-disciplined men come not near the heretic, who stores up (in his memory certain formulas), as$though he understood their worth, and repeats them by rote (lit. as a tongue-lesson).$The heretic, if worsted in the assembly, will abuse the family (of his opponents); or he$will spring up and challenge them to fight. 
Vain babblers.$Many are the men that utter many things,—who long to raise up (in debate), from$mere love of talking and an itching tongue; who do not themselves apprehend the$power and might of learning; who know not the way to utter with penetrating force$what they have learnt; and who know not what defeat means.
The neophyte.$Without any learning of his own, the fool has obtained one formula from overhearing$the lessons of a tutor (who was teaching others), yet unabashed he enters the circle$of the good, speaks it out, and makes exhibition of his mean understanding. 
Convincing arguments.$They who arise to utter words of wisdom, having associated themselves with the$assembly of those who rage and burn and fume with anger, like beasts, for the mere$sake of victory, not understanding the truth, shall see their own teeth like pumpkin$seeds in their hands! 
Fools disgrace themselves in the assembly of the learned.$When foolish men chant their lesson, not knowing the fruit that lesson yields, but$uttering words that gender wrath, the learned ones, whose fame dies not, will stand$by ashamed, sorely pitying the mother that bare them. 
The letter easy, the meaning hard.$Like the charms of those who sell their love for what they gain, the sacred texts are$easy to those who rightly learn then; but like the minds of these whose forms are soft$as tender shoots, the meaning is hard to all
Book collectors and scholars.$Although men gather together books in abundance, and, not understanding their$contents, fill the whole house with them; the scholar who merely take care of books$are of one sort, and the scholar who understand their contents, and make them clear$to others, are of another sort. 
A perfect commentary.$Lord of the land of long chains of hills where the wild cattle assemble in herds!$Is that a good commentary to a faultless composition, which consists of the words of$those who do not sift it thoroughly, in the four divisions of summary, amplification,$minute exposition, and supplementary information, and thus exhibit the full import? 
Critics.$Will those who are not of high family, however they may study learned works, be fit$instruments to guard others from faults of speech? And men of good family who are$well learned will not (seem to) be aware of the deficiencies of those who do not$comprehend the works they talk of.
Only the wise value the wise.$Men of sense receive as a reality the words from the mouth of the loving ones who$graciously teach virtue. The (ignorant)wretch, himself unreal, speaks (of virtue) with$contempt. Just so the ladle distinguishes not the flavour of the rice boiled in milk. 
Foolish people hearing hear not.$When men of ungrudging soul declare the way of virtue, those who are not rightly$disposed, although they give ear, hear not. Even so the currier's dog seizes on and$devours leather, not appreciating the flavour of milk and rice. 
Useless in life and unmourned in death.$What matters it whether they live or die—the shameless stupid people who do no$good, not even as much as a grain of millet, though they see by every species of$example the way in which their life so sweet to them, passes away in the twinkling of an eye?
Misanthropy.$Since being's days are few, and life no safeguardowns, and guilt by many blamed is$rife, mid many men, why, laughing not with all they see, should any sulk apart, and$nurse a sullen hate ? 
The evil tongue.$A man has gone before the assembly that had gathered together, and contemning$another has reviled him. Now if the reviled one remain silent, the reviler is to be$wondered at if he survive; (for abuse is his very life, and the patience of the reviled$one has closed his mouth.) 
Dishonoured old age.$He who before old age comes, has not undertaken and zealously carried out works$of virtue, will be pushed about in the house addressed in harsh language, and bidden$to get on one side or to go out, by even the maid-servants.
Wasted lives.$Men of scanty wisdom are those who do not themselves enjoy any sweets of life,$bestow no benefactions on worthy persons, draw not nigh the good path that$safeguards (the soul), but infatuated and absorbed in the acquisition of wealth, pass$away their days of life in vain. 
The miser's death-bed.$In the very earliest time (in early youth) they take not food for the journey which they$must make (into another world), tying tightly the wallet on their shoulders ; but tying$tightly (their treasure bags), they say, 'In after days we will learn wisdom;' the gold$these idiots will indict with their hands (as legacies, when they are speechless, and in$the grasp of death) will be as sour vilam fruit.
Saints when they suffer, sinners when they prosper.$When poor, or when disease's deadly grasp they feel, to other world alone their$minds are given ; but when wealth grows, no thought, small as a grain of mustard$seed, give they to other world —these souls unwise!
Friends hurried away; the unwise heed it not.$Though they have gained a human frame, of virtue think they not! In vain they spent$their days. Alas! and yet they see death eagerly hasting to snatch away those$infinitely dear, like to their very souls! Why is this so?
Men disport themselves in the very meshes of death's net.$While the turtle's murderers have put it into the pot, and kindled fire beneath, it sports$unconscious of its fate: such is their worth who joy entangled in life's not, while death,$the mighty murderer, waits to seize them. 
Postponing virtuous action to a time that never arrives.$They went to bathe in the great sea, but cried 'we will wait till all its roar is hushed,$then bathe!' Such is their worth who say, 'we will get rid of all our household toils and$cares and then we will practise virtue and be wise.'
A high tone of manners and morals.$Though a man be of good caste, have performed deeds of ascetic virtue, acquired$learning, is of good family and attained a ripe old age, so that in these five points he$is faultless; yet his ignorance of what is thoroughly good, without stain, sanctioned by$ancient precedent, and of good renown in the world's ways, will render all his$advantages like thin, watery milk with boiled rice.
Stones and senseless men.$Stones are much better than low men ; since, though those (too) are utterly without$apprehension of your words, yet they (stones) are of assistance to those that employ$them, in as much as they at once stand (where they are fixed), remain (where they are$put), lie (where they are laid), and remove (when they are moved). 
A fool angry without cause, longs to abuse.$If the fool, though nothing is to be gained (by such conduct), acting as though he had$gained something, waxing wroth against those who disdain (or are unable) to$contend with him, cannot say and utter forth in his wrath a string of evil words a$grievous itching will gnaw his tongue. 
It is a hard thankless task to bend the worthless to our will.$Lord of the sea-shore where the laurel with its bright foliage flowers! The poor$(pretence of) intimacy enjoyed by those who follow after (wealthy but) utterly$uncongenial men, and say 'we will bend them to our will,' is like loosing one's hand$while digging into a rock. 
Ants around the neck of the closed oil-jar.$If there be ghi in the pot, though they cannot get at it, the ants will swarm without$ceasing around the outside ; and so the people of the world will cling to and not leave$the possessors of wealth, though these give them nothing. 
Fools make all life sad for themselves.$No good each day they gain; nor deed of virtue do; nothing to needy men impart; nor$know they joy of loved ones' sweet embrace ; devoid of fame they live: do such not$loathe the days they live? 
Friendship without reciprocity.$Friendship with those who are destitute of exquisite goodness, and who, though you$cultivate them with affectionate deference, (morosely) say we entertain affection for$none,'—though it should yield as its fruit the earth, which the sea with its noisy chime$of leaping billows girds around,—would be only affliction. 
Self-laudation.$The learning a man has acquired, his world - renowned excellence, and his nobility of$birth, will gain for him respect when the bystanders celebrate them; but if he himself$proclaim them, the young kinsmen crowding around will deride him as one afflicted$with a mania not to be mitigated by any medicine.
Teaching wasted.$The fowl, though each morning duly you scatter broken grain into its very mouth, will$ceaselessly scratch in the refuse-heap; so, though you expound and show the base$man works of learning, full of weighty wisdom, he will but the more resolutely go on in$the way in which his mind finds delight. 
The base will not seek the company of the wise and good.$If you say to the base man, ‘Let us without delay go to seek refuge with faultless$sages possessors of mature wisdom,' he will probably get up and make off,$exclaiming, 'Let us go and slumber!’ or he will perhaps demur, and change the subject. 
Promotion does not spoil the good nor improve the bad$Lord of the goodly land of swelling torrents! If thoroughly worthy men gain some$added dignity, their nature knows no deviation, but they go on in the same even path$of virtue ; and although the base obtain promotion, his conduct too changes not,$(promotion betters him not.) 
Small benefits seem great to the wise ; and vice versa.$Lord of the goodly land of glistening torrents! The excellent will deem any favour$done them, though small as a grain of millet, to be large as a palm tree. You may$constantly confer favours huge as a palm tree, but they are not benefits, when$conferred on those who are not grateful. 
The dog prefers to feed on refuse. Nature will out!$The dog, though you tend it with care, feeding it from a golden vessel, will watch, eye$fixed for others' leavings ; even so, although you receive the base as if they were$possessed of greatness, the deeds they do will be otherwise (their real character$will be seen by their conduct). 
The base intoxicated by some trivial gain.$Though they obtain imperial wealth, the excellent never utter a vaunting word; but if$at any time the base see some small fraction added to his scanty store, he will deem$himself great as Indra.
The slipper.$Though made of faultless yellow gold, enwrought with choicest pearls, the slipper$serves but for one's foot; though the base be deemed prosperous through the wealth$they have gained, their baseness will be seen by their actions. 
The base man's habit of life. Victorious lord of the good mountain land! The base is$mighty in bitter words, is destitute of kindliness, rejoices in others' sorrows, is ever$and anon full of sudden wrath, will run up and down and pour contempt on all he meets. 
No intimacy possible with the base.$Lord of the resounding sea's cool shore, where the Neythal breathes honied$fragrance round! The worthy, if men for many days stand waiting in their train will say$'these are old acquaintance,' and will make the place pleasant to them; the base in$such circumstances feel no affection, but simply despise them. 
Prosperity does not elevate the base.$Hear O Sir! The little bullock-calves will not learn to bear the yoke and draw the$chariot, though you give them cut grass, clip them, and constantly rub them down;$so, though they have gained wealth, the base will be seen (to be so) by the deeds they do.
Age does not improve the essentially base.$The thoroughly wise, though young in years, will guard themselves in stern selfrepression. The low unwise as age comes on become mature in evil works, and are$like reeds wind-shaken, hollow still! 
Fine perception unattainable by the obtuse.$Though frogs flourish long in a rich large lake, they never rid themselves of their slime;$so it is hard for those void of fine perception, even when they have learned$pure and excellent text-books, to acquire the gift of clear understanding. 
Detraction easy only to the base.$Lord of the goodly land of mountain chains! It is hard to stand before a man, and$publish even his praise. How then can mean men's tongues depreciate a man's good$qualities and proclaim his faults while standing before him?
Base men vaunt themselves like wantons.$Chaste women trick not out their charms of womanhood, as is as the wont of the$wanton. Like fountains ever fresh those others make display of every charm, and$vaunt their beauty as they pass.
You must extort from the base what you want.$The base are like the chisel, that, though it is over the bud (to be sculptured), moves$not without some one to strike it. On those who are courteous these confer no boon$whatever. They will do everything for those who use violent means. 
Each thinks upon his own favourite place. The good remember only benefits$conferred on them ; the bad only injuries.$The hill-man thinks upon the beauty of his hills; the farmer thinks upon his fields that$have yielded him rich crops; the good think on the boons bestowed by worthy men;$the base man's thoughts are fixed on abuse he has received. 
The good are grateful; the base ungrateful and malignant.$The good attach themselves to those that have done them one act of kindness, and$forgive a hundred wrongs that arise. The base receive seven hundred benefits, but$one wrong will turn them all to evil. 
Base men illiberal even in prosperity.$Worthless persons even in high estate do not the deeds that men of noble birth$perform even in their poverty. Okeen-eyed maid! Men may enring and arm the boar's$tusks, but it will not even so become a warlike elephant. 
Vain dreams. We fade as a leaf.$‘To-day, at once, a little hence, we shall gain our end!’ So many speak and think, and$joyously tell it out among their friends ; but soon their eager minds are changed; and$they have perished like a lotus leaf.
Wealth without heart.$Though born in the water, and its hue appear green, the Netti's pith knows no$moisture; so in the world are men of amplest wealth whose hearts are hard as stones$upon the rocky mountain fell. 
The wife.$The mansion meets the clouds. A stately band of warders keep watch around. Gems$listen therein like lamps. What then? Where the owner has not a wife of dainty$excellence: the house within is a waste, hard to explore.
Outward guards avail nothing.$Though compassed round with a faultless guard of swords, if once they gain freedom,$in little time they are stained with every fault; and long is the time those soft-voiced$once spurn every law of right 
The evil qualities of a bad wife and their effects.$Death is the wife that stands and dares her spouse to strike! Disease is she who$enters not the kitchen betimes! Demon domestic is she who cooks and gives no$alms! These three are swords to slay their lords ! 
The second marriage.$He hears (that marriage is another name for) dread, and yet he dreads it not! He$hears the fearful funeral drum, but it gives him no sense ! Again to take a wife and to$dwell bewildered amidst domestic enjoyments is a fault that merits stoning; so say (the wise). 
Different modes of life.$The best thing is a life spent in penitential practices. The middle course is to live with$dear ones around. The worst of all is, with the thought that we have not enough,$through desire of wealth subserviently to follow those who understand us not. 
Three kinds of men; those that learn, those that enjoy, and those that complain. The$men of noblest mood pass their time in learning. The middle sort pass their time in$the enjoyment of good things. The last and lowest cry : 'Our food is not sweet,' 'We've$not got our fill,' and in angry mood lie sleepless.
Like father, like son! The red grain's swelling germ in after time grows up and yields$that same red grain.— O fertile crofted village lord, whose fields are filled with$ripening crops of that same grain !—Wisdom of son is wisdom of the sire. 
Bad times.$The wealthy men of great possessions and the perfect have perished, while wantons'$sons and base men multiply. The lowest takes chief place, and, like the umbrella's$handle, this world is upside down! 
Misery of unfeeling selfishness.$Lord of the good land of mighty hills whence streams descend sweeping along pearls!$Better men should jump down a precipice than live with a mind not disposed to$assuage the pain of the dear ones who tell them of their heart's pain. 
The wantons' love.$‘The mountain freshed, and the love of those adorned$With pendant jewels rare examined calmly prove$To differ nought: that fails when rains that feed it fail;$And love of these fails too, when income fails!’
The wantons' mercenary character.$The lamp's light and harlot's love examined well are seen to differ not a whit; the$lamp's light goes out when the feeding oil is consumed ! and the harlot's love is spent$when the lavish hand has spent its wealth.
The wanton's self-interested professions.$She (of enticing beauty), adorned with choice jewels, said forsooth, 'I will leap with$you down the steep precipice;' but on the very brow of the precipice, because I had$no money, she, weeping and pointing to her aching feet, withdrew and left me alone! 
Courtezans forsake those who have no wealth.$Though he be Mal, the fiery-eyed, whom in the heaven's fair homes immortals$worship, if in hand he bring no gift the women tender as the buds men cull, will$straight dismiss him, bowing low with folded hands
Money makes a man the wanton's darling.$To the damsels of loveless hearts, whose eyes are as beauteous as blue water-lilies,$those who have no wealth are as poison! Even those who have turned the (oil) press,$in sight of all men, if they have wealth, are as sugar to them.
Wantons and their paramours.$The silly ones, who are as beasts, seek the embraces of women who are like the eel,$which shows one head to the snake, and another head to the fish, in the sweet clear$lake : (are of a double and deceitful nature). 
Feigned love becomes open hostility.$‘We will never part, like the precious stone strung on its thread, or the Andril,' said the$damsel with golden bracelets: she has now become the horn of a fighting ram (she$angrily repels me). Dear heart! dost linger still, or wilt thou go? 
Ridiculous infatuation of the wanton's dupe.$Those who fondly reckon upon the devoted love of the worthless wanton, that, like$the wild ox, licks the hand and despoils men of their wealth, and then, like the buffalo,$bounds away, shall suffer the deserved ridicule of many. 
Bought embraces.$Those whose avowed purpose it is to walk in the way of rectitude seek not the$embrace of the fascinating, fawn-eyed damsels, who walk in a way of their own' who$are pleasant when gratified with gifts, and when they are filled (when no more gifts$are to be expected) are like the horn of the fighting ram. 
Let him be deceived that will.$Let those accept (wantons' false love), who take them as their own believing the$words uttered to inspire belief, by the bright-browed ones, who keep concealed within$the cruelty that lurks in their heart. Those whose bodies are their sole wealth belong$to none, (i.e. they have no souls to give!). 
Lust blinds men.$Though the dupes clearly discern and know the guileful intentions entertained by the$bright browed ones, even where their minds are (apparently) set upon some persons,$they whose bodies are full of sin do not recognise it!
Freedom from temptation.$Though women live famed as Ayirani for rarest gift of chastity, absence of men that$stand enamoured of their charms is a help in way of good to those of fragrant brow$who guard themselves. 
A true wife, in time of poverty, if friends come in enough to drink up the sea, performs$her duties with kindness of speech.$When in the straitened time they cook and eat with but one pot of water on the$hearth,— if relatives arrive enough to drain the sea, the soft-voiced dame, the glory$of her home, well fulfils each seemly duty. 
The real home!$On every side the narrow dwelling lies open, on every part the rain drips down; yet, if$the dame has noble gifts, praised by townsfolk for her modest worth, such a$housewife's blest abode is indeed a home! 
The wife : 'placens uxor.'$She is sweet to the eye, and adorned in the way that a lover loves; she enforces$awe: her virtue shames the village folk; she is submissive; but in fitting place is stern,$yet sweetly relents :—such a soft-voiced dame is a wife. 
The modest woman cannot understand shamelessness.$‘Whenever our spouse takes us in his embrace, we feel a timid shame as if we saw$him then for the first time and they (wantons) daily, through desire of gain, submit to$the embraces of many! How can this be?' 
A modest wife like a javelin in the hand of a hero$As the scroll that he reads, whose inmost heart well understands it, is goodly wealth$with him who is graced by a generous spirit. As a keen weapon in the hand of a$clear-souled hero, is the loveliness that a modest woman owns. 
The injured wife to her confidante:$'The lord of the town has bought, it seems, black gram and red gram, a tuni and a$pathakku, as if they were all the same! He, whose chest is broad as a mountain,$having associated with the beautiful browed ones , — inferior to me! — unpurified,$seeks my society too!'
The neglected wife$‘O minstrel, utter not cruel words, or if thou utter them, softly draw back thy step, and$go to utter them to those who are like the lute's right side; for we, to the lord of the$town, are as its left.' 
Meek complainings (to her maid).$'I am she, forsooth, that felt a pang when a fly alighted on the lord of the town,$surrounded by cool rice-fields over which the waters gleam, where they pluck the rich$grass! And I am she who have lived to look upon his breast adorned with cool$sandal-wood paste, which has been warmly embraced by others.
The pining wife$'Minstrel , utter not a gross falsehood, saying that he who wears a garland of opening buds will favour us!’$‘To the lord of the town we are as the (tasteless) tip of the sugar-cane ; therefore, tell$(such a tale) to them who are like its middle (sweet, juicy) joints.'
‘The way of true love never did run smooth.'$'Lord of the cool shore of the deep bay, where the gleaming ocean's restless billows beat!$'If there be no fond embrace, a sickly hue will spread itself (over her face); and, if$there be no lovers' quarrels, love will lack its zest.$‘To embrace and disagree is the one way (of love).' 
The Lonely one$‘To those who were wont to strain in close embrace their own beloved whose broad$breast was girt with garlands, when the rains patter down, it is as though one beat$the funeral drum through all the regions where the muttering of the thunder is heard$from out the clouds; since they are deprived of their loved one's society.'
The forsaken one at eventide$At wildering eventide, when workmen all put by their tools, she culled choice flowers,$and wove a gay garland ; — then let it fall from her hands, and wailed, 'What can this$wreath avail to me who weep alone?’ 
The lover says to his friend in regard to his forsaken bride :$'Regarding the setting sun, and wiping away one by one with her soft finger the tears$that well up in her eyes, suffused with red, sobbing she lies resting her arms on the$couch, setting off the days on those same tender fingers : alas; are they my faults she is counting up?'
The lover in a figure praises the lustre of his beloved's eye, and the beauty of her$arched brow; and indicates also his own timid reverence$‘The little kingfisher seeing the eyes of my beloved (as she was disporting in the$tank) and taking them for carp, followed her; but though it followed, and poised itself$aloft, it darted not down, recognising her gleaming brow bent above them as a bow! 
The mother bewails the hardships of the rough desert path over which her tender daughter will follow her beloved.$'When I applied the (softest) cotton soaked in the red dye to the foot of her whose$waist is lovely, and whose mouth breathes the fragrance of the red water-lily, did she$not cry "gently, gently," and shrinking draw it back? And oh! has it endured the stony, desert path?'
Grief of the deserted wife$When those who con the palm leaf scrolls had ceased, in eve's din twilight hour, she$thought of her absent spouse! and weeping plucked the flowers from out her wreath,$and brushed the odorous sandal from her lovely breast! 
The confidante demands of the bride if she can endure to walk after her beloved through the desert, she replies :$'Thou hast said, O maiden with burnished brace - lets ! have you strength to walk on$the morrow after your beloved? When one (a warrior) has obtained a splendid horse,$that very instant he has learned how to ride it! (his enthusiasm teaches him).
The mother now aware of her daughter's flight, says:$‘My breast, my necklace of pearls, and my whole body she embraced ! I knew not$what it portended. It was the sign, it seems, made by my lovely one that she was$about to set out on the path where the herds of antelopes flee in fright from the tiger.' 
The lady complains of her lover's long absence$The triple-eyed (Sivan), the crow, the hooded snake; the mother that bare me: what$have these done amiss ? Maiden whose bosom bears the Gongu buds, all gold! The$way my lover went for wealth is my pain.’
